When your flow gives a red bar with the info that there is an update. <br>
Then you could perform an update, but how? <br>

Before you do an update, read the release notes, if this update makes sense for you. <br>
To read the release notes, click on the red bar. <br>

If you want to update, click on the "Download" button. <br>
A .json file will be downloaded. Later we will import this .json file, to execute the update. <br>

Before going to the next steps, first the original flow needs to be disabled. <br>
The update is not a real update, but importing the new flow. That's why the original flow needs to be disabled, to prevent you have 2 flows which are the same. <br>
Double click on the flow name <br>

On bottom left, click on "enable", the text will change in "disable" <br>
Click "done" and then "deploy" <br>

Now import the downloaded .json file <br>
Select the button "select a file to import" and choose the downloaded .json file <br>

The update (the replaced flow) is done. <br>
Test the changed flow. If you are happy, then delete the disabled flow. <br>
If not happy, delete the new imported flow and enable the old flow again. <br>
